<p><strong>Your questions answered</strong></p>
<p>Here's some of the most commonly asked questions regarding online finance.</p>

<p><strong>Once my application is approved, what happens next?</strong></p>
<p>

If you are offered the ability to e-sign your credit agreement and choose to do so, a PDF of your credit agreement will be displayed on screen.

Credit scoring works by awarding points for each answer given on the application form such as age, income and occupation, together with information obtained from credit reference agencies. This information allows us to produce consistent decisions, ensuring all our applicants are treated fairly. Credit scoring does not discriminate on the grounds of sex, race, religion or disability.
